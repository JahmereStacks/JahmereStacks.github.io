    One of my Life Goals is to buy my own home and car in the future
</p>
<p class="sfont">
  Owning a car can also be linked to improving job opportunities, especially if you live in an area with limited public transportation.
</p>
<p class="sfont">
  A home is one of the most significant financial investments a person can make. It represents a long-term asset that can appreciate in value over time, building wealth and providing financial security in the future.

  <br>
  <h3>UALBANY</h3>
  <details>
    <summary><mark>#1 Pick so far here why</mark></summary>
    This is the #1 pick for me because not only do they have a great track program but they have a major that aligns with my passion for being an Electrician. The major is listed as The BS Electrical and Computer Engineering program.
